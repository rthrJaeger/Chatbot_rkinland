Prerequisites

Java 11 or higher

JavaFX SDK

iText PDF library (AGPL-3.0)

Installation:

1. Clone the repository

2. Important: Use the provided rkinland.pdf template file included in this repository. The application's field mapping is specifically configured for this exact PDF version. Using a different version of the form may result in incorrect field placement or missing data in the generated PDF.

3. Compile and run the application

Language Selection: Choose between German and English interface

Interactive Interview: Answer questions step-by-step as prompted by the chatbot

Input Validation: The system validates your inputs in real-time and asks for corrections if needed

Form Completion: Complete all required sections

PDF Generation: Review your information and generate the completed PDF form

Architecture

The application follows a state-machine pattern with the following key components:

ChatbotState Enum: Defines all possible states in the conversation flow
Input Validation: Comprehensive validation for different data types
Internationalization: Resource bundles for German and English languages
PDF Integration: Direct form field mapping and custom text overlays using iText
JavaFX GUI: Responsive user interface

Field Mapping

The application uses a combination of:

Standard PDF form fields: For checkboxes, radio buttons, and basic text fields

Custom text overlays: For date/time fields and complex positioning requirements

Using a different PDF template will likely result in:

Misaligned text placement

Missing or incorrectly filled fields

Incomplete form generation
